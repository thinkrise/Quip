## Introduction
Fun quiz service game for a variety of genres. This project encompasses 
the logic of the game and the service component. The game is intended 
to provide topical subjects with which to test oneself. It allows for 
human vs human multiplayer, as well as non-player characters vs human 
gameplay. 

Intended as a test bed for developing small web-based projects, 
this project is open source with contributions from the community. Its 
structure is designed to make further extension and development easier 
with external community resources. 

To read about setup, take a look at the
